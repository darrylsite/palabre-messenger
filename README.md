# palabre-messenger

A chat system written in Free Pascal using Lazarus
Palabre Messenger is an example of code I wrote for an example of chat software which is written in lazarus RAD & Free Pascal compiler.Then compiles the code for Windows and Linux.
The particularity of the chat is that it uses a JSON-RPC protocol and that objects are serialized / de-serialized as JSON object when communicating.
The server also uses a JSON database. The code is written entirely in Object Pascal, and UML diagrams are provided with the code.
